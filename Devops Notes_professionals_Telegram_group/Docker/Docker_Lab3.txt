   How to write a Dockerfile

    To build a Docker image you need to create a Dockerfile. It is a plain text file with instructions and arguments. Here is the description of the instructions we’re going to use in our next example:

    FROM = set base image
    RUN = execute command in container
    ENV = set environment variable
    WORKDIR = set working directory
    VOLUME = create mount-point for a volume
    CMD = set executable for container
	
	For reference : https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/
	
	Lab Exercise : Let’s create an image that will get the contents of the website with curl and store it to the text file. We need to pass website url via environment variable SITE_URL. Resulting file will be placed in a directory mounted as a volume.
	
	FROM ubuntu:latest  
    RUN apt-get update  
	RUN apt-get install --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests -y curl  
	ENV SITE_URL https://google.com/  
	WORKDIR /data  
	VOLUME /data  
	CMD sh -c "curl -L $SITE_URL > /data/results"
	
2. Build an Image:

docker build . -t test-curl

    docker build builds a new image locally.
    -t flag sets the name tag to an image.
	
	to check the image is created or not : docker images

3. We can create and run container from the image. Let’s try it with default parameters:
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/vol:/data/:rw test-curl

you can check the output here : cat ./vol/results

4. lets try with google.com
docker run --rm -e SITE_URL=www.google.com -v $(pwd)/vol:/data/:rw test-curl

To see results saved to file run:

cat ./vol/results
