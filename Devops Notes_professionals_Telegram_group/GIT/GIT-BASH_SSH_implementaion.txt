Generating a new ssh key

1. ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
2. Enter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa):[Press enter]

If you want to give a secure password type password else it would be passwordless

3. Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
4. Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]

5. Ensure the ssh-agent is running:

    If you are using the Git Shell that's installed with GitHub Desktop, the ssh-agent should be running.
    If you are using another terminal prompt, such as Git for Windows, you can use the "Auto-launching the ssh-agent" instructions in "Working with SSH key passphrases", or start it manually:
	# start the ssh-agent in the background
    eval $(ssh-agent -s)
    Agent pid 59566
	
6. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file.
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

7. Copy the SSH key to your clipboard.

If your SSH key file has a different name than the example code, modify the filename to match your current setup. When copying your key, don't add any newlines or whitespace

clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard

8. Login to your public GitHub account
In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.

9. In the user settings sidebar, click SSH and GPG keys.

10. Click New SSH key or Add SSH key

11. In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key. For example, if you're using a personal Mac, you might call this key "Personal MacBook Air".

12. Paste your key into the "Key" field. 

13. Click Add SSH key. 

14. If prompted, confirm your GitHub password.
