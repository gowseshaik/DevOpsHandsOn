How to convert VM image to dockerfile with shutit:
===================================================

Step 1

Install ShutIt as root:

sudo su -
(apt-get update && apt-get install -y python-pip git docker) || (yum update && yum install -y python-pip git docker which)
pip install shutit

The pre-requisites are python-pip, git and docker. The exact names of these in your package manager may vary slightly (eg docker-io or docker.io) depending on your distro.

You may need to make sure the docker server is running too, eg with ‘systemctl start docker’ or ‘service docker start’.
Step 2

Check out the copyserver script:

git clone https://github.com/ianmiell/shutit_copyserver.git

Step 3

Run the copy_server script:

cd shutit_copyserver/bin
./copy_server.sh

There are a couple of prompts – one to correct perms on a config file, and another to ask what docker base image you want to use. Make sure you use one as close to the original server as possible.

Note that this requires a version of docker that has the ‘docker exec’ option.
Step 4

Run the build server:

docker run -ti copyserver /bin/bash

You are now in a practical facsimile of your server within a docker container!
