Bind Mounts and working directories:
Binds : mounting a host folder to inside a container. at the time of recreation of binds, binds will be disconnected.
Volume : is a persistence drive, which will create by docker volumes command and will be used for sahred volumnes. Volumes will not be down at the time of recreation of containers.

docker run -it python /bin/sh
exit

to run our python app container from the current working dir
docker run -it -v $PWD/app:/app python /bin/sh


#!/bin/bash
pip install -r requirements.txt && python app.py

docker run -it -v $PWD/app:/app python /bin/sh run.sh --> throughs an error that /bin/sh: 0: Cant't open run.sh

so for this specify working directory to start off.
docker run -it -v $PWD/app:/app -w /app python /bin/sh run.sh

now you have to get the docker container ip
docker inspect $(docker ps -q) | jq -r .[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress
output: 172.17.0.2
curl $(docker inspect $(docker ps -q) | jq -r .[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress):5000
