There are three legacy versions of the Compose file format:

    Version 1. This is specified by omitting a version key at the root of the YAML.

    Version 2.x. This is specified with a version: '2' or version: '2.1', etc., entry at the root of the YAML.

    Version 3.x, designed to be cross-compatible between Compose and the Docker Engineâ€™s swarm mode. This is specified with a version: '3' or version: '3.1', etc., entry at the root of the YAML.
