All About Docker

- first release was March 20, 2013
- Written in Golang
- Utilizes the host OS
- Originally built on LXC
- Uses a filesystem called "overlay2", this filesystem is used to access from host. it will help to reuse filesystem files and overlap them and used as a container. Files needed for the container are stored in plain sight.

- docker conatiners are essentially system processes isolated by "cgroups"

Two host example:

Host A : Hypervision : you can use for multiple os, single software will be used inside single os, you cant use same software on same os.
Host B : Docker Engine : directly you can use mulptile softwares
