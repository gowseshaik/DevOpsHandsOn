What is push-based and pull-based CI/CD pipeline for Kubernetes?👨🏻‍💻

In a push-based pipeline, an external system, like a CI pipeline, generates build triggers to deploy the changes to the Kubernetes cluster following a commit to a version control system(github,GitLab,Bitbucket) repository. In such a model, Kubernetes cluster credentials are exposed outside the trust domain of your cluster which is not recommended.
Example - Jenkins, github actions, GitLab CICD

In a pull-based pipeline, Kubernetes operators deploy the changes from inside of a cluster whenever new images are pushed to the registry.
With a pipeline that pulls an image from the repository, your cluster credentials are not exposed outside of your production environment.
Example - ArgoCD, Spinnaker
